# Flask PWA
> A progressive webapp template.

Flask PWA is supposed to be a goto template when I start a new Flask project. It is constructed on a Model-Template-Controller perspective, which I find clear enough for my current projects.

You can check a live version at [Heroku](https://flask-pwa.herokuapp.com).

## Features

* Blueprint oriented, Flask 1.0 project
* Instantly deployable on Heroku
* Off-the-shelf progressive web app behaviour
* Service worker based on Workbox
